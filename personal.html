                I was born in South Korea. My hometown is Donghae-city, a small ocean city where many tourists love to visit. Many K-dramas were taken in my hometown.

                <h1> People Around Me </h1> 
                I'd like to take advantage of this section to introduce my close friends and family. I have a younger brother. He is three years younger than me, and we really get along with each other. Since I left Korea when I was 16 years old, we had to be far apart for about 10 years. I think it made us have more close relationships than others. We share lots of secrets or concerns that we do not tell our parents.
                <br><br> While I'm in Hong Kong, I usually spend my time in Hong Kong with local friends rather than Korean friends. My best local friend is Stephanie. She is not a PolyU student but We met at a Korean restaurant in TST where she worked as a server. I often sleep over at her house, go shopping together, or visit the fancy cafe. Even her dad knows me well, so he gave me Lai See in this Lunar New Year. 
                <br><br> I am living with a Korean roommate at a PolyU Student Hall. She is also three years younger than me, but we are close friends. It was kind of funny that both of us requested a local roommate when we first applied to a student hall, but we ended up being roommates. She is fluent in Mandarin as she lived in Shanghai for ten years. She helps me a lot whenever I have a communication problem at restaurants.
